# Mock Contracts

This directory contains mock contracts used for testing the RedDragon ecosystem:

## Token Mocks

- `MockERC20.sol` - Basic ERC20 token implementation with minting capability
- `MockToken.sol` - Extended ERC20 token mock
- `MockX33.sol` - Mock implementation of the x33 token
- `MockXShadow.sol` - Mock implementation of the xShadow token

## System Mocks

- `MockJackpot.sol` - Mock implementation of the jackpot contract
- `MockVe69LP.sol` - Mock implementation of the ve69LP contract
- `MockPaintSwapVRF.sol` - Mock implementation of the PaintSwap VRF provider
- `MockShadowRouter.sol` - Mock implementation of the Shadow DEX router
- `MockShadowQuoter.sol` - Mock implementation of the Shadow DEX quoter

These mock contracts are used in the test files to simulate the behavior of external contracts and dependencies without requiring a full deployment of the entire system.
