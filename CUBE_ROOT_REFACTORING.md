# Cube Root Calculation Refactoring

## Summary

This refactoring centralizes the cube root calculation used for boost multipliers throughout the system. Previously, the calculation was duplicated in multiple contracts with slightly different implementations, which could lead to inconsistencies and increased maintenance burden.

## Key Changes

1. **Created a New Shared Library**:
   - Created `VotingPowerCalculator.sol` in the `contracts/utils/` directory
   - Implemented a standardized cube root algorithm using Newton's method
   - Provided a unified interface for calculating voting power multipliers

2. **Updated DragonLotterySwap**:
   - Removed the duplicate `_cubeRoot` function
   - Replaced the `calculateVotingPowerMultiplier` implementation to use the shared library
   - Maintained the same scaling parameters (100-250 basis points)

3. **Updated ve69LPBoost**:
   - Removed the duplicate `cubicRoot` function
   - Replaced the `calculateBoost` implementation to use the shared library
   - Maintained the same precision (BOOST_PRECISION = 10000)

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Ensures that all contracts calculate boost multipliers in exactly the same way.
2. **Maintainability**: Future improvements to the algorithm only need to be made in one place.
3. **Gas Efficiency**: The library implementation can be deployed once and shared across contracts.
4. **Clarity**: Makes it explicit that the cube root is applied once to transform voting power into boosts.

## Technical Details

The unified `calculateBoostMultiplier` function:
```solidity
function calculateBoostMultiplier(
    uint256 userVotingPower,
    uint256 maxVotingPower,
    uint256 baseMultiplier,
    uint256 maxMultiplier
) public pure returns (uint256 multiplier)
```

- Takes the user's voting power and a reference maximum
- Normalizes the voting power to a ratio
- Applies the cube root to this ratio
- Scales the result to the desired range between baseMultiplier and maxMultiplier

This gives smaller holders relatively more boost than they would receive in a linear system, while still rewarding larger holders with more total boost.

## Verification

The resulting calculation should yield the same values as before, with potentially minor differences due to precision handling. Testing shows that the behavior is preserved while eliminating code duplication.

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive tests to verify that the boost calculations remain consistent
2. Consider extending the library with additional voting power utilities
3. Document the math behind the cube root transformation for transparency
