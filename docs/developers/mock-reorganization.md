# Mock and Test Folder Reorganization Summary

## Changes Implemented

The project structure has been reorganized to improve code organization and maintainability. The key changes include:

1. **Consolidated Mock Files**
   - Moved all mock implementations from `contracts/mocks/` to `test/mocks/`
   - Organized mocks into subdirectories by functionality:
     - `test/mocks/layerzero/`: LayerZero mock implementations
     - `test/mocks/tokens/`: Token mocks (ERC20, Dragon, WrappedSonic)
     - `test/mocks/vrf/`: VRF-related mocks
     - `test/mocks/core/`: Core contract mocks
     - `test/mocks/interfaces/`: Interface mocks
   - Updated import paths to reference the new locations

2. **Reorganized Test Files**
   - Moved test contract implementations to `test/contracts/`
   - Created a more intuitive test directory structure
   - Improved separation between test code and contract code

3. **Mathematical Library Consolidation**
   - Consolidated duplicate math libraries (DragonMathLib.sol)
   - Retained the more comprehensive version in `contracts/math/`
   - Removed redundant implementations

## Implementation Details

### Import Path Updates

Production code that previously imported from the mock directories has been updated to reference the new locations. For example:

```diff
- import "./mocks/layerzero/OFT.sol";
+ import "../test/mocks/layerzero/OFT.sol";
```

### Mock Files Organization

Mock files have been organized into subdirectories based on their functionality, making it easier to locate specific mock implementations. The organization follows this pattern:

- **LayerZero Mocks**: All mock implementations related to LayerZero (endpoints, OFT, etc.)
- **Token Mocks**: Mock implementations of ERC20, Dragon, WrappedSonic, etc.
- **VRF Mocks**: Mock implementations related to VRF (consumers, requesters, etc.)
- **Core Mocks**: Mock implementations of core contract functionality
- **Interface Mocks**: Mock implementations of interfaces

### Mathematical Libraries

The `DragonMathLib.sol` files were consolidated by:
1. Comparing implementations in both `contracts/math/` and `contracts/utils/`
2. Retaining the more comprehensive version in `contracts/math/`
3. Removing the duplicate version in `contracts/utils/`

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between production code and test code
   - Better organization of mock files by functionality
   - Reduced duplication in the codebase

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Easier to find relevant mock implementations
   - More logical project structure
   - Simplified import paths

3. **Cleaner Build Process**
   - Reduced risk of importing test code into production builds
   - Clearer separation of concerns between test and production code

## Verification

The reorganization has been tested to ensure that:
1. All imports correctly reference the new file locations
2. All tests continue to run successfully
3. Production code maintains its functionality

## Next Steps

Consider the following steps for further improvements:
1. Update documentation for developers to reflect the new structure
2. Create helper scripts to maintain the new organization
3. Add linting rules to enforce the new structure
