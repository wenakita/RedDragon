# DRAGON Lottery System Overview

The DRAGON protocol features an innovative lottery mechanism that automatically rewards users who swap Wrapped Sonic (wS) for DRAGON tokens. This document provides a high-level overview of the lottery system.

## Core Mechanics

The lottery features several key components:

### Entry Mechanism

Users enter the lottery automatically when they swap Wrapped Sonic (wS) for DRAGON tokens:

- **No Separate Purchase**: Entry is integrated directly into the token swap process
- **Qualifying Amount**: Swaps must exceed a minimum threshold to qualify
- **Eligible Participants**: Only direct users (`tx.origin`) can win, preventing contract/bot entries
- **One-Way Trigger**: Only triggered when swapping wS â†’ DRAGON, not vice versa

### Probability System

The winning probability uses a dual-component system:

1. **USD-Based Linear Probability**:
   - $1 swap = 0.0004% chance
   - $10,000 swap = 4% chance
   - Linear scale between these points

2. **ve69LP Voting Power Boost**:
   - Users holding ve69LP tokens receive a multiplier
   - Uses cube root scaling for diminishing returns
   - Maximum 2.5x boost at maximum voting power

3. **Combined Max Probability**:
   - 10% maximum (with $10,000 swap and maximum boost)

### Jackpot Distribution

When a user wins:
- 69% of the jackpot is transferred to the winner
- 31% remains in the jackpot to seed the next round
- No manual claim required - automatically sent to winner's wallet

## Technical Components

The lottery system consists of several specialized contracts:

1. **DragonSwapTrigger**: Detects swaps and initiates lottery entries
2. **DragonSwapTriggerV2**: Enhanced version with improved price oracles
3. **SonicVRFConsumer**: Manages cross-chain randomness requests
4. **ArbitrumVRFRequester**: Interfaces with Chainlink VRF
5. **DragonJackpotVault**: Manages jackpot accumulation from fees

## Fee Structure

The lottery is funded through the DRAGON token fee structure:

- **Total Buy/Sell Fee**: 10% of transaction amount
- **Universal Burn**: 0.69% of ALL transfers
- **Jackpot Allocation**: 6.9% of all buy/sell fees go to jackpot
- **Fee Distribution**: 2.41% goes to ve69LPfeedistributor

## Randomness Generation

The lottery uses a cross-chain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to ensure provably fair randomness:

1. Randomness request initiated on Sonic chain
2. Request forwarded to Arbitrum via LayerZero
3. Chainlink VRF generates randomness on Arbitrum
4. Result returned to Sonic via LayerZero
5. Winner determined based on randomness and probability threshold

## Benefits and Key Features

- **Trustless Execution**: Fully on-chain, no central authority
- **Provably Fair**: Uses cryptographically verifiable randomness
- **Self-Sustaining**: Jackpot grows organically from protocol activity
- **Ve69LP Utility**: Enhances value of ve69LP through probability boost
- **Trading Incentive**: Creates additional reason to swap to DRAGON
- **No Additional Cost**: Integrated into existing tokenomics
