# Reference Implementation

This directory contains reference implementations of contracts that are used as a basis for the main implementation. These files are for reference purposes only and should not be modified or implemented directly.

## Important Notes

- These contracts are archived reference implementations
- DO NOT implement these contracts directly
- DO NOT modify these files
- These files are maintained for historical reference only

## Purpose

The files in this directory are kept for reference purposes to:
1. Document the original implementation
2. Provide historical context
3. Serve as a reference for future development
4. Maintain compatibility with existing systems

## Usage

These files should only be used as reference material. When implementing new features or making changes, always refer to the main implementation in the `contracts` directory.
